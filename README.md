## Project Details:
Aditi Rao developed a pizza ordering website as her final project for CS50.
The website includes a home page with a description of pizzas, their origins, and Aditi Rao's details.
A navigation bar facilitates the ordering process.

Clicking on "ORDER NOW!!" redirects users to a separate website.
Users can choose between vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.
For vegetarian pizzas, a menu with prices for different sizes (e.g., Margherita, Veggie Treat) is provided. Users can select a pizza and choose its size. A contact number is available for phone orders.
Non-vegetarian pizzas follow a similar process with a menu (e.g., Texas BBQ, Meat Treat) and size selection.

## User Interface:
The website is designed with high-quality images, thoughtful presentation, and relatable content to influence and appeal to customers.
Navigation is made easy with a clear layout, and the ordering process is streamlined.

## Conclusion:
The pizza ordering website developed by Aditi Rao demonstrates the application of web development skills acquired during CS50.
It provides a user-friendly interface, allowing customers to explore pizza options and place orders with convenience.
